<div class="story-body"> <p>Located in the Bronx, Crotona International High School had 333 students enrolled in the 2018-2019 school year. More than 130 of them were homeless, spending their nights at motels, shelters or on the streets.</p> <p>High schoolers need to study for their standardized exams in different subjects to achieve college proficiency and get a high school diploma. But with a number of homeless students two times higher than the city average, Crotona International High School got the worst SAT scores during the latest school year.</p>  <p>There are more than 26,000 high school students identified as homeless in New York City, and the number is still on the rise –– it more than doubled over the last decade, according to data from the New York State Department of Education.</p> <p>Not meeting a college proficiency index or the state standards for a high school diploma increases the chance that these students will become part of the larger issue of adult homelessness in the city.</p> <p>National research from Chapin Hall’s Voice of Youth Count, a University of Chicago policy research center, shows that the lack of high school diplomas is the single greatest risk factor for homelessness among young adults. Students who did not graduate had 4.5 times the risk of experiencing homelessness compared to peers who completed high school.</p>

<div class="story-body scrollytelling"> <div id="chart-01" class="chart"></div> <div class="steps"> <div class="step" id="nothing"> <h3>High School Homelessness Increases</h3> <p>In 2018-2019, the number of New York City district and charter schools students identified as homeless decreased by half a percentage point from the 2017-2018 school year. Outside the city, there are 1,000 less homeless high schoolers this year.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="city-step"> <p>But statistics for high schoolers in the city didn't get the scant decrease. The numbers keep growing in a cohort where students also have to prepare to get a high school diploma and meet college proficiency.</p> </div> </div> </div> <script src="linegraph.cdba811c.js"></script> <body class="dark-theme">
<div class="story-body"> <p>What is the city doing about it? Not enough, according to advocacy groups.</p> <p>Coalition for the Homeless released a report in April on what they called a “homelessness crisis.” They included a report card, giving Mayor Bill de Blasio a failing grade on his efforts to create sufficient housing for the homeless. They gave Governor Andrew Cuomo multiple failing grades on housing vouchers and homelessness prevention.</p> <p>In 2017, de Blasio released his “Turning the Tide on Homelessness” initiative, which promised to reduce the number of people in shelters by 2,500 over five years. But Coalition for the Homeless actually projected an increase of 5,000 men, women and children living in shelters by 2022.</p> <p>As part of the initiative, the mayor implemented “Housing New York 2.0,” which would build or preserve 200,000 affordable apartments, with 15,000 units saved for homeless families. But that is not enough, advocates said.</p> <p>“New York City’s homelessness crisis will not improve until the Mayor uses every tool at his disposal,” said policy director Giselle Routhier in a press release. “That means devoting at least 30,000 apartments in his Housing New York 2.0 affordable housing plan for homeless New Yorkers, with at least 24,000 of those apartments to be created through new construction.”</p>

<div class="story-body"> <p>Domestic violence can bring a family to flee a violent situation, having to relocate or look for a shelter. This means that students may have to move away from their schools or even have to transfer.</p> <p>Andrea Pizano, director of policy research at Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness, said students might sometimes move to other neighborhoods a half hour or two hours away from their schools, which poses a challenge for getting to school on time, or getting there at all. “This could lead to chronic absenteeism, when students are absent 10% or more of the school year,” Pizano said. </p> <p>Homeless high schoolers don’t typically have access to SAT tutoring, practice tests or multiple opportunities to improve their scores, Pizano said, resulting in lower scores than their counterparts. The highest 20 percent of SAT scores belonged to high schools where homeless students made up 4 percent of the student body. There were five times as many homeless kids at schools delivering the lowest 20 percent of the scores. </p> <p>Students of color are disproportionately affected, which means they will also underperform at SAT scores and Regents exams compared to their white peers. Black and Hispanic students made up over 90 percent of the student body at the top 10 districts with highest concentrations of homelessness. Five of these districts are in the Bronx, four are in Brooklyn and one – District 6 – is in Manhattan.</p> <p>At Crotona International High School, 88 percent of the student body is Hispanic.</p> </div>

Schools with higher rates of homelessness have lower SAT averages.</p> <p>The SAT average score for New York City public schools in 2019 was 950, marked by the red line.</p> </div> <div class="step" id="top-step"> <p>Black and Hispanic students make up over 50 percent of the student body at these high schools.

<div class="story-body"> <p>As part of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s “College Access for All” initiative, the city’s department of education launched the “SAT School Day” initiative in 2017 to offer an opportunity for all 10th and 11th grade students to take the PSAT and SAT free of charge during a regular school day.</p> <p>A record number of students took the SAT after the initiative was implemented, Chalkbeat reported. But homeless high school students are still underperforming.</p> <p>“We see that even with the SAT School Day, homeless students are less likely to take the SATs at all, and in addition they are less likely to take the SAT two or more times. That also goes for the PSAT, and they are also less likely to pass their Regents exams,” Pizano said.</p> </div> <body class="dark-theme">
<div class="story-body"> <p>Regents exams are also used to measure college proficiency, but homeless students still underperform. These tests are graded by performance levels from 1-4, which reflect the extent to which students demonstrate the level of understanding expected at their grade level. Levels 3 and 4 are considered “college proficient,” according to the state education department.</p> <p>State education department data shows that the cohort of students entering high school in 2015 were 20 percent less proficient at Regents tests than their peers. </p> <p>“These kids are living in shelters, sharing a house, living unsheltered in cars, parks, abandoned buildings,” Kramer said. “The trauma they endure makes it harder for them to focus on school.” </p> </div> <script src="scrollytelling.4c8d8e13.js"></script>
