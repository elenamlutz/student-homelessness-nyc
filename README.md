## NYC School Districts, Student Homelessness and SAT's

High schoolers need to study for their standardized exams in different subjects to achieve college proficiency and get a high school diploma. But with a number of homeless students two times higher than the city average, Crotona International High School got the worst SAT scores during the latest school year.

There are more than 26,000 high school students identified as homeless in New York City, and the number is still on the rise –– it more than doubled over the last decade, according to data from the New York State Department of Education.

Not meeting a college proficiency index or the state standards for a high school diploma increases the chance that these students will become part of the larger issue of adult homelessness in the city.

Homeless high schoolers don’t typically have access to SAT tutoring, practice tests or multiple opportunities to improve their scores, Pizano said, resulting in lower scores than their counterparts. The highest 20 percent of SAT scores belonged to high schools where homeless students made up 4 percent of the student body. There were five times as many homeless kids at schools delivering the lowest 20 percent of the scores.

Students of color are disproportionately affected, which means they will also underperform at SAT scores and Regents exams compared to their white peers. Black and Hispanic students made up over 90 percent of the student body at the top 10 districts with highest concentrations of homelessness. Five of these districts are in the Bronx, four are in Brooklyn and one – District 6 – is in Manhattan.
