## NYC School Districts, Student Homelessness and SAT's

Located in the Bronx, Crotona International High School had 333 students enrolled in the 2018-2019 school year. More than 130 of them were homeless, and spent their nights at motels, in shelters or on the streets. Many are left without a time or place to study, and might face unpredictable commutes. Academic achievement may be among the least of their day to day concerns.

It may then come as no surprise that Crotona International High School got the worst SAT scores during the latest school year, according to New York City's Department of Education data.

There are more than 26,000 high school students identified as homeless in New York City, and the number is still on the rise –– it more than doubled over the last decade, according to data from the New York State Department of Education.

Homeless high schoolers don’t typically have access to SAT tutoring, practice tests or multiple opportunities to improve their scores, Pizano said, resulting in lower scores than their counterparts. The highest 20 percent of SAT scores belonged to high schools where homeless students made up 4 percent of the student body. There were five times as many homeless kids at schools delivering the lowest 20 percent of the scores.

Students of color are disproportionately affected, which means they will also underperform at SAT scores and Regents exams compared to their white peers. Black and Hispanic students made up over 90 percent of the student body at the top 10 districts with highest concentrations of homelessness. 

I downloaded datasets from the New York City Department of Education of each high school's student body, average SAT scores for Math, Reading and Writing, and homelessness percentage for each school. Using pandas in Python, I cleaned and merged different datasets and analyzed the correlation between homelessness, race and SAT scores in 2019.
